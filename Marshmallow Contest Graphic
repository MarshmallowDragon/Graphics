TO DO: Fill that out^^**/

/*

I recently had a conversation with a friend (you know who you are) about tons of different ways to eat marshmallows! And this idea stemmed from that.

  So for this contest, give me your wackiest, funniest, yummiest, visibly delectable and most creative way of eating marshmallows!

  Put your entry in a spin-off and I will judge on clean, commented code, creativity, and presentation.
